    "One of the most common interactions between police and the public are traffic stops. With over 50,000 stops per day in the United States, there is a lot of data to track, and analyze, to have a better idea of who is being stopped, why they were stopped and what the outcome was. This information is helpful to know to understand if resources are being used wisely, and to draw attention to conscious or unconscious biases in police behavior. I will look specifically at Colorado traffic stop data.\n"
